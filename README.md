"# bmi-app" 

PYTHON VERSION: 3.11.9<br />

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS:<br />
      A. Install the tkinter library in windows powershell: (pip install tkinter). Then install the add-on customtkinter: (pip install customtkinter).<br />
      a. Compile settings.py<br />
      b. Compile bmi.py<br />
      c. A window will pop up<br />
      d. Click metric in the top right corner for desired units<br />
      e. Adjust weight using the 4 buttons of different weights<br />
      f. Adjust height using the slider<br />
      g. Notice how while you move the slider or change the weight the output bmi-score that is displayed dynamically updates with every change you make.<br />

HIGH LEVEL DESIGN:<br />
      1. Designed and implemented a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) utilizing the customtkinter library.<br />
      2. Key features include interactive widgets such as a height slider and weight adjustment buttons, dynamically reflecting changes in height and weight through the trace method.<br />
      3. Incorporated metric switch functionality allowing seamless conversion between metric and imperial units for height and weight metrics.<br />

WHY I MADE THIS APP:<br />
      I am a fitness enthusiast and a common problem I noticed was that not many people know how to calculate their BMI score.<br />
      Not only this but it is also not intuitive for some to know how to convert from metric units to imperial units.<br />
      To solve this issue I created this app to make calculating your BMI-score user-friendly and easy.<br />

FYI:<br />
      empty.ico is not necessary at this step<br />
      change title bar function does not produce desired results. Maybe having to do with version of python<br />
