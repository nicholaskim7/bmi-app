"# bmi-app" 

a. Compile settings.py<br />
b. Compile bmi.py<br />
c. A window will pop up<br />
d. Click metric in the top right corner for desired units<br />
e. Adjust weight using the 4 buttons of different weights<br />
f. Adjust height using the slider<br />
*. Notice how while you move the slider or change the weight the output bmi-score that is displayed dynamically updates with every change you make.<br />

*FYI: empty.ico is not necessary at this step<br />
      change title bar function does not produce desired results. Maybe having to do with version of python<br />
