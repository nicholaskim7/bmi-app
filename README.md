"# bmi-app" 

a. Compile settings.py
b. Compile bmi.py
c. A window will pop up
d. Click metric in the top right corner for desired units
e. Adjust weight using the 4 buttons of different weights
f. Adjust height using the slider
*. Notice how while you move the slider or change the weight the output bmi-score that is displayed dynamically updates with every change you make.

*FYI: empty.ico is not neccessary at this step
      change title bar function does not produce desired results. Maybe having to do with version of python
