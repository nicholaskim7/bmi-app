"# bmi-app" 

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS:
      a. Compile settings.py<br />
      b. Compile bmi.py<br />
      c. A window will pop up<br />
      d. Click metric in the top right corner for desired units<br />
      e. Adjust weight using the 4 buttons of different weights<br />
      f. Adjust height using the slider<br />
      *. Notice how while you move the slider or change the weight the output bmi-score that is displayed dynamically updates with every change you make.<br />

HIGH LEVEL DESIGN:
      1. Designed and implemented a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) utilizing the customtkinter library.<br />
      2. Key features include interactive widgets such as a height slider and weight adjustment buttons, dynamically reflecting changes in height and weight through the trace method.<br />
      3. Incorporated metric switch functionality allowing seamless conversion between metric and imperial units for height and weight metrics.<br />


*FYI: empty.ico is not necessary at this step<br />
      change title bar function does not produce desired results. Maybe having to do with version of python<br />
